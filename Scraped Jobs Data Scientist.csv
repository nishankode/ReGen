About The Role

A Data Scientist in Flipkart is required to develop and implement various Computer Vision and Deep Learning models for the various projects like object detection / segmentation, representation learning, attribute extraction using MTL, OCR, AR-VR, scene graphs, etc. The responsible person should be able to communicate and collaborate with multiple stakeholders representing various teams to better understand the problem at hand. At a fundamental level, the responsible person should be able to dive deep into a problem statement and extract interesting insights as well as solutions. In addition to being a quick learner, a DS is expected to get involved in active research projects with a view to publish them.

What you’ll do

Understand Business and product needs and use CV or DL techniques to provide solutions to those in a time bound fashion.
Communicate and collaborate with business and product teams to have a better understanding of the project so as to be able to drive it within the DS team.
Get involved in in-depth exploration of solutions using various methods and extract insights from data as well as models, which are to be shared with business and product teams.
Active participation in working with new methods and learning new technologies, both in the area of data science and data engineering.

What You’ll Need

M.Tech in CS, Data Science, Computer vision, Machine Learning or any related field with experience ranging from 5 to 10 years through publications/deployed solutions/projects.
Deep understanding of the algorithms (theory and application) that they have worked on.
Good grasp on the theory and practise of basic computer vision and deep learning algorithms. It is not expected that the candidate has actually worked on all these modules.
Strong proficiency in Python is necessary.
Proficiency with CNN (convolution neural networks) and some of the state of art deep learning architectures such as ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet etc in computer vision
Experience in handling of millions of images
Knowledge of computer vision frameworks and libraries
Experience with deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras.
Background in Object oriented design, scalability and reusability
Exposure to JIRA, Git, agile project management is a plus

Our mission is to deliver the world’s computer with an industry-leading supply chain. CSCP is responsible for strategic sourcing, customer demand forecasting, capacity planning and management, supply chain planning and execution, capacity provisioning, and decommissioning and dispositioning of datacenter assets worldwide.

Mirosoft Cloud Planning is one of the most central functions within CSCP due to its direct impact on Microsoft cloud business success. This team forecasts, plans and manages the majority of Microsoft’s cloud services and directly influences cloud user experience. This is a central function that closely partners with Engineering, Finance, Supply Chain, Data Centers, NPI and Deployment Engineering.

India Center-of-Excellence (CoE) is a comparatively new team which offers capabilities to make planning processes efficient and best-in-industry by bringing expertise in areas like Supply Chain Management, Data Science, Engineering and Analytics. The team is growing very fast to get ahead of the Cloud Supply Chain demand increase and set up practices for structured long, medium and short-range planning.

Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

Researching and developing production-grade models (forecasting, anomaly detection, optimization, clustering, etc.) for our global cloud business by using statistical and machine learning techniques.
Manage large volumes of data, and create new and improved solutions for data collection, management, analyses, and data science model development.
Drive the onboarding of new data and the refinement of existing data sources through feature engineering and feature selection.
Apply statistical concepts and cutting-edge machine learning techniques to analyze cloud demand and optimize our data science model code for distributed computing platforms and task automation.
Work closely with other data scientists and data engineers to deploy models that drive cloud infrastructure capacity planning.
Present analytical findings and business insights to project managers, stakeholders, and senior leadership and keep abreast of new statistical / machine learning techniques and implement them as appropriate to improve predictive performance.
Oversees and directs the plan or forecast across the company for demand planning. Evangelizes the demand plan with other leaders.
Drives clarity and understanding of what is required to achieve the plan (e.g., promotions, sales resources, collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment [CPFR], budget, engineering changes) and assesses plans to mitigate potential risks and issues.
