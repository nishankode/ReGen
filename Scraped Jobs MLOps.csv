Our mission is to deliver the world’s computer with an industry-leading supply chain. CSCP is responsible for strategic sourcing, customer demand forecasting, capacity planning and management, supply chain planning and execution, capacity provisioning, and decommissioning and dispositioning of datacenter assets worldwide.

Microsoft Cloud Planning is one of the most central functions within CSCP due to its direct impact on Microsoft cloud business success. This team forecasts, plans and manages the majority of Microsoft’s cloud services and directly influences cloud user experience. This is a central function that closely partners with Engineering, Finance, Supply Chain, Data Centers, NPI and Deployment Engineering.

India Center-of-Excellence (CoE) is a comparatively new team which offers capabilities to make planning processes efficient and best-in-industry by bringing expertise in areas like Supply Chain Management, Data Science, Engineering and Analytics. The team is growing very fast to get ahead of the Cloud Supply Chain demand increase and set up practices for structured long, medium and short-range planning.

Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

Researching and developing production-grade models (forecasting, anomaly detection, optimization, clustering, etc.) for our global cloud business by using statistical and machine learning techniques.
Manage large volumes of data, and create new and improved solutions for data collection, management, analyses, and data science model development.
Drive the onboarding of new data and the refinement of existing data sources through feature engineering and feature selection.
Apply statistical concepts and cutting-edge machine learning techniques to analyze cloud demand and optimize our data science model code for distributed computing platforms and task automation.
Work closely with other data scientists and data engineers to deploy models that drive cloud infrastructure capacity planning.
Present analytical findings and business insights to project managers, stakeholders, and senior leadership and keep abreast of new statistical / machine learning techniques and implement them as appropriate to improve predictive performance.
Oversees and directs the plan or forecast across the company for demand planning. Evangelizes the demand plan with other leaders.
Drives clarity and understanding of what is required to achieve the plan (e.g., promotions, sales resources, collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment [CPFR], budget, engineering changes) and assesses plans to mitigate potential risks and issues.
Oversees the analysis of data and leads the team in identifying trends, patterns, correlations, and insights to develop new forecasting models and improve existing models.
Oversees development of short and long term (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly) demand forecasts and develops and publishes key forecast accuracy metrics. Analyzes data to identify potential sources of forecasting error. Serves as an expert resource and leader of demand planning across the company and ensures that business drivers are incorporated into the plan (e.g., forecast, budget).
Leads collaboration among team and leverages data to identify pockets of opportunity to apply state-of-the-art algorithms to improve a solution to a business problem.

Consistently leverages knowledge of techniques to optimize analysis using algorithms.

Modifies statistical analysis tools for evaluating Machine Learning models. Solves deep and challenging problems for circumstances such as when model predictions are not correct, when models do not match the training data or the design outcomes when the data is not clean when it is unclear which analyses to run, and when the process is ambiguous.
Provides coaching to team members on business context, interpretation, and the implications of findings. Interprets findings and their implications for multiple businesses, and champions methodological rigor by calling attention to the limitations of knowledge wherever biases in data, methods, and analysis exist.
Generates and leverages insights that inform future studies and reframe the research agenda. Informs both current business decisions by implementing and adapting supply-chain strategies through complex business intelligence.
Connects across functional teams and the broader organization outside of Demand Planning to advocate for continuous improvement and maintain best practices.
Leads broad governance and rhythm of the business processes that ensure cross-group collaboration, discussion of key issues, and an opportunity to build proposed solutions to address current or future business needs.
